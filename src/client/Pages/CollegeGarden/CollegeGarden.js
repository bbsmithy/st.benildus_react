            <u>ST. BENILDUS COLLEGE – INAUGURAL SCHOOL GARDEN</u>
          </h1>
          August 2016 saw the Transition Year students begin the construction of the St. Benildus College Garden. The
          project has a wide scope. It is{' '}
          <strong>
            {' '}
            to build an environmentally sustainable school garden that will serve the school and the wider community.
          </strong>{' '}
          It has the potential to have:{' '}
          <strong>
            strong educational links, enhance the natural surroundings, raise awareness of environmental concerns and
            facilitate local to global community action.
          </strong>{' '}
          To date the project has forged relationships and links with; Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council through the
          award of an Environment Grant, Johnstown Boys National School, a local Residents Association, a Construction
          Company operating in the local area, Green Schools, Geography classes undertaking soil samples, 5th Year
          Agricultural Science students who have begun to sow potatoes in part of the vegetable patch under construction
          and some very enthusiastic 5th Year students as an option in Senior P.E.
          <h2>Aims and Objectives of the Initiative</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>To build a school garden</li>
            <li>To plant trees, bushes and flowers</li>
            <li>To plant and nurture fruit trees and fruit bushes </li>
            <li>To plant and care for a vegetable patch </li>
            <li>To plant and care for a herb garden </li>
            <li>To build and house a polytunnel to nurture seedlings and develop fruit and vegetables</li>
            <li>
              To create biodiversity by building an insect motel and an environment to encourage wildlife such as birds,
              squirrels, bees, butterflies and other creatures
            </li>
            <li>To harvest rainwater</li>
            <li> To create self-sustainable compost (compost heap)</li>
            <li>To educate students in a multitude of disciplines</li>
            <li> To create cross curricular links which strengthens and reinforces educational lessons </li>
            <li>To support and reinforce Department of Education and Skills Initiatives</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>
            A key element is that students carry out all works directly which promotes sustainable community
            involvement.
          </strong>
          Intended outcome
          <br />
          The intended outcome of the project is for all members of the school community to contribute, enjoy and
          benefit from the creation of a school garden: Students, Teachers, Parents and Families. The College aims to{' '}
          <strong>enrich the education of the students</strong> through all facets of school life; academic, health and
          welfare, recreational activities and the growth of individuals and groups in school activities. We offer a{' '}
          <strong>holistic approach to education</strong> and aim{' '}
          <strong>
            to meet the individual; spiritual, intellectual, moral, artistic, emotional, physical and social needs of
            each student so that they are better equipped for life. A school garden offers many physical and
            psychological health benefits for students and adults.
          </strong>
          The Project is for transition year students and other students in our school{' '}
          <strong>
            {' '}
            to build a school garden from scratch, whereby students complete all works from start to finish.
          </strong>{' '}
          From; research, garden design, hard landscaping, soft landscaping, building flower beds a paved/stone path,
          compost heap, a seating area as an outdoor classroom, planting trees and flowers,{' '}
          <strong>weeding, sowing, growing, nurturing, caring and loving nature.</strong>
          It will be an <strong>‘outside’ reflective area</strong> and the space can be used in the future to house
          school graduations whereby families <strong>reflect and rejoice together as a community.</strong>

          <h2> Rationale and Other Benefits</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Rationale and Other Benefits- </strong> students, adults, the school community and wider community
              groups will benefit both physically and psychologically.
            </li>
            <li>
              {' '}
              <strong>Provides a catalyst for neighbourhood and community development – </strong> the school have
              entered in to discussions with a local residents group to form a partnership to craft and build bird
              feeders and hopefully other items.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stimulates Social Interaction – </strong> a crucial building block for the successful attainment
              of self-esteem, confidence, mental health awareness and overall well-being. The stimulus and positive
              atmosphere of the development of a school garden encourages teamwork, communication and interpersonal
              skills which are key skills for people to hone.{' '}
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Encourages Self-Reliance –</strong> The school garden produce will be used for the school cookery
              module in the future. Transition Year students; growing, tending, harvesting and then cooking their own
              food, exhibits the sustainable food chain and highlights the transparency between, ‘the farm and the
              fork’.{' '}
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Beautifies Neighbourhoods – </strong> The school garden will encourage and sustain local wildlife,
              enable outreach programmes in the community and will facilitate the All-Ireland Pollination Plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Produces Nutritious Food –</strong> our students and their families will directly benefit,
              students will harvest fruit, vegetables and other yields and sell the produce in the future at a local
              food fair and to the school canteen, as part of a Transition Year Mini-Company Venture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduces Family Food Budgets –</strong> The families of the students and the teachers at our
              school.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conserves Resources – </strong> We will engage in water harvesting, producing our own compost,
              using recycled and upcycled materials and aim to become a sustainable environment. We are ambitiously
              hoping to build our own glasshouse from scratch using a combination of recycled and new materials.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Creates opportunities for recreation, exercise, therapy, and education – </strong> Students are
              the ones building the garden, no contractors or other service providers will play any part. Everything
              will be completed by the project group. The building and development of the school garden provides active
              physical exercise and social and environmental recreation. Numerous educational links are present between
              school subjects and Department of Education and Skills programmes and initiatives.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Preserves Green Space – </strong> The project preserves green space and a sustainable green space
              in an urban built of area. It also provides a sanctuary for wildlife to flourish.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Provides opportunities for intergenerational and cross-cultural connections – </strong> our
              project enables social cohesion as in the future school events such as our United Through Sport Day with
              local Special Olympics groups can be housed in part in our school garden and we also hope to continue to
              forge links with other community groups for the mutual benefits of everyone in our community.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          By the end of the 2016–2017 academic year it is hoped to have; installed and planted the vegetable patches,
          planted fruit trees and bushes, painted the boundary walls, built a pollytunnel, installed a formal garden
          entrance gate, completed the construction of a decked area and the further delineation of boundaries and
          paths. Congratulations to all those Transition Year students, 5th Year students and other members of the
          school community that have been involved to date for their hard work.
