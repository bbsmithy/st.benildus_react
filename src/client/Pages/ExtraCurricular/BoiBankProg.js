            The school’s continued involvement with the Bank of Ireland
            Secondary Schools Programme has proved to be both rewarding and
            engaging for the whole school community. It’s the only
            extra-curricular activity that actually creates funding for the
            school.

          <h3>Operation of the School Bank</h3>
          <p>
            At the start of each academic year both the School Bank Coordinator
            and the allocated Bank of Ireland School’s Programme members host a
            joint talk to all Transition Year students to highlight the B.O.I
            School Programme and the opportunity to apply for a position on the
            School Bank Team. This is a very competitive and rewarding process
            for all students involved. The Bank of Ireland School Bank has been
            designed to support schools in providing financial education to
            students. It gives students the opportunity to work in the School
            Bank across a variety of roles from Bank Manager to Customer Service
            Official learning about banking and how to work as an effective
            team. The School Bank also provides the opportunity for students to
            open a bank account and makes it easy for them to save on a regular
            basis; via frequent on-site School Bank visits. The Student School
            Bank team are supported by experienced Bank of Ireland staff members
            from the local branch to ensure the smooth operation of the School
            Bank, and to support the team with any questions and queries they
            may have.

              The Programme exposes Transition Year students in the management
              of a potentially profit making venture with practical goals and
              rewards.

              The school bank team visit a B.O.I branch and are given a tour of
              the premises and shadow Bank of Ireland staff undertaking their
              normal day to day activities. B.O.I staff meet with the team,
              explain their roles, show the team around the Dundrum branch and
              both parties start to build a working relationship.
            </li>
            <li>
              This year when the team visited, it was Christmas customer day at
              the bank and footfall was higher than a normal day. The team had
              the opportunity to meet and greet customers coming into the branch
              and members of the public walking by and assisted in spreading a
              bit of holiday cheer by giving out mince pies and collecting for
              charity. Mutual benefits for B.O.I and the School Bank Team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every Transition Year student that applies for the school bank
              team has the opportunity to prepare and sit an interview with Bank
              of Ireland staff members. This process is another valuable
              experience to candidates whether they are successful or not in
              becoming a bank team member. The experience of conducting an
              interview with representatives of a business working in the local
              community is both challenging and rewarding.
