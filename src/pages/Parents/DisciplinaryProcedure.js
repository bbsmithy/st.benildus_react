          <h4>St Benildus College Procedure for Expulsion Policy:</h4>
          <p>
            The Board of Management of a recognised Secondary School has the
            authority to expel a student. Expulsion of a student is a very
            serious step and is one which will only be taken by the Board in
            extreme cases of unacceptable behaviour.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>
            A proposal to expel a student requires serious grounds such as that:
          </h4>
          <p>
            The student’s behaviour is a persistent cause of significant
            disruption to the learning of other students or to the teaching
            process. The student’s continued presence in the College constitutes
            a real and significant threat to the safety of others in the school
            community. The student is responsible for serious breaches of the
            College Code of Behaviour.   There may be exceptional circumstances
            where the Board of Management forms the opinion that a student
            should be expelled for a first offence. This would arise when a
            student was involved in a significant breach of the College Code of
            Behaviour such as:
          </p>

          <p>
            A serious threat of violence against another student or member of
            staff.  Actual violence or physical assault.  Supply or possession
            of illegal substances in the school or when on school related
            activities.  Sexual assault or harassment.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h4>Procedure:</h4>
          <p>
            The College authorities will follow fair procedure when proposing to
            expel a student. The steps will include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A detailed investigation will be carried out under the direction
              of the Principal. In line with fair procedures and natural justice
              the Principal will inform the student and his parents about the
              details of the alleged misbehaviour and that it could result in
              expulsion. The student and parents will be given an opportunity to
              respond to the complaint of serious misbehaviour. Parents will be
              informed in writing of the alleged misbehaviour. The Principal at
              this stage may decide to suspend the student in accordance with
              the provisions of the Education Welfare Act 2000 if, in his
              opinion, such an action is appropriate to ensure the good order
              and discipline are maintained and that the safety of students is
              served.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where the Principal forms a view, based on the investigation, that
              expulsion may be warranted, the Principal will make a
              recommendation to the Board of Management to consider expulsion.
              The student and parents will be notified of the date of the
              hearing by the Board of Management and will be invited to that
              hearing. Parents will be advised of their right to make a written
              and oral submission to the Board of Management at the hearing. The
              Board meeting for the purpose of the hearing will be properly
              conducted in accordance with Board procedures. At the hearing the
              Principal and the parents or a student aged eighteen years or
              over, put their case to the Board in each other’s presence. After
              both sides have been heard the Board should ensure that the
              Principal and parents are not present for the Board’s
              deliberations. It is the responsibility of the Board to decide
              whether or not the allegation is substantiated and, if so, whether
              or not expulsion is the appropriate sanction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where the Board of Management, having considered all the facts of
              the case, is of the opinion that the student should be expelled
              the Board will inform the parents in writing about its conclusions
              and will notify the Educational Welfare Officer in writing of the
              intention to expel a student. The student cannot be expelled
              before the passage of twenty school days from the date on which
              the Educational Welfare Officer receives the written notification.
              The Board may delegate authority to the Principal to suspend the
              student during the passage of these twenty days where it considers
              the student’s continued presence in the College constitutes a real
              and significant threat to the safety of others in the school
              community.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where the twenty day period following notification to the
              Educational Welfare Officer has elapsed, and where the Board of
              Management remains of the view that the student should be
              expelled, the Board of Management should formally confirm the
              decision to expel. Parents should be notified immediately that the
              expulsion will proceed and of their right to appeal the decision
              to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills
              under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Board of Management will review (at regular intervals) the
              College Policy and Procedures for Expulsion. This review will
              ensure that the Policy and Procedures are consistent with College
              ethos and Code of Behaviour and that expulsion is used
              appropriately.
            </li>

          <h4>St Benildus College Procedure for Suspension Policy:</h4>
          <p>
            In St. Benildus College all students have the right to learn in an
            orderly and caring environment. All students, teachers and other
            members of the College community have the right to be treated fairly
            and with dignity in an environment free from disruption,
            intimidation, harassment and discrimination.
          </p>
          <p>
            In certain cases of unacceptable behaviour it may be in the best
            interests of the school community and the student involved that the
            student is removed from classes or the school for a period of time.
            The Principal has the authority, under the Articles of Management
            for Secondary Schools to suspend any pupil for a limited period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suspension should be a proportionate response to the behaviour that
            has caused concern.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decision to suspend a student requires serious grounds such as
            that:
          </p>
          <p>
            The student’s behaviour has had a seriously detrimental effect on
            the education of other students.  The student’s continued presence
            in the school at this time constitutes a threat to safety. The
            student is responsible for serious misconduct or serious damage to
            property.
          </p>
          <p>
            A single incident of serious misconduct may be grounds for
            suspension.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>The purpose of Suspension is:</h4>
          <p>
            To make clear to the student that his behaviour is seriously
            unacceptable. To allow him to reflect, in consultation with parents
            / guardians, on his response to the situation. To help the student
            realise that even more serious consequences may ensue if his
            behaviour is not modified.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h4>Procedure:</h4>
          <p>
            When a decision to suspend is reached parents will be notified by
            phone and written confirmation will follow. The letter will indicate
            the reason for suspension, the commencement date and the length of
            suspension. Parents will be informed of their right to appeal the
            suspension to the school authorities or to the Department of
            Education and Skills under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 (if
            the total number of days for which a student has been suspended in
            the current school year reaches twenty days).
          </p>

          <p>
            The College is obliged to inform the National Education Welfare
            Board if the suspension is longer than six days or if the student
            has been suspended for a cumulative total of more than twenty days
            during a school year.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h4>Appeals:</h4>
          <p>
            The Appeals process will at all times follow the principles of
            natural justice. Parents and the student will be made aware of the
            details relating to the behaviour which resulted in the decision to
            suspend. An internal appeal may be made to the Principal who may
            recommend that a sub committee of the board of Management be
            appointed to facilitate an early decision. The decision of the Board
            will be communicated in writing to the appellants.If dissatisfied
            the appellants have the right to appeal to the Department of
            Education and Skills under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998.
          </p>

          <p>
            The grounds for removal of a suspension may include: Successful
            appeal to the Principal or Board of Management. Successful appeal
            under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998. New circumstances come
            to light. An alternative strategy being agreed in consultation with
            parents / guardians.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h4>Procedures for return to College:</h4>
          <p>
            The College may request agreed conditions for the formal
            reintroduction of the student into the College. e.g.  Attendance at
            counselling.  Undertakings of good behaviour. Other pastoral
            supports.  On Report for a defined period of time.All students
            returning from suspension will be required to attend at least one
